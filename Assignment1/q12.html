        <q>The only thing we have to fear is fear itself.</q>
        <cite>-Franklin D. Roosevelt</cite>

        <q>Men go abroad to wonder at the heights of mountains, at the huge waves of the sea, at the long courses of the rivers, at the vast compass of the ocean, at the circular motions of the stars, and they pass by themselves without wondering.</q>
        <cite>-Saint Augustine</cite>
